# Welcome To Mailchain

[Mailchain](https://app.mailchain.com) is the communication layer for web3. It makes it possible for people to communicate in a crypto-native way. The platform consists of two parts:

1. An open source, multi-chain protocol for sending encrypted messages between blockchain wallet addresses.
2. A simple, unified inbox application that makes it easy for users to view and send messages using the protocol and to keep track of their on-chain activity. It's just like using email.

People often need to communicate in the context of their wallet or blockchain identity. Communication may be related to their transaction history, web3 activity or some type of important notification.

Use cases include trade receipts, transaction confirmations, peer-to-peer social messages, community updates, and other onchain events.

Web3 provides no standard way to handle communication. Some applications work around the problem by asking users to link another method of contact (e.g. email address, phone number etc.) to an application. This compromises privacy by asking users to link or reveal an identity. Keeping track of valuable, relevant information, such as NFT mints, DeFi positions, and DAO votes across these channels can become overwhelming, confusing, and pose a privacy risk.

# Introduction

At DexText, user protection is a priority. To enhance security and fairness, we have established a system of reserved wallet addresses. Unlike usernames, wallet addresses are unique identifiers on the blockchain, non-transferable by nature. They cannot be sold or traded, eliminating any incentive for hoarding addresses.

DexText has reserved certain categories of addresses:

- Addresses associated with known web3 projects.
- Addresses associated with administrative and support functions.

:::caution

Wallet addresses are inherently non-transferable. Once an address is linked to a blockchain wallet, it cannot be reused.

DO NOT buy or accept an address from anyone. Always ensure you have sole access to the private key associated with the wallet. The original owner who has access to the private key can always access the associated DexText account.

## How can I tell if a wallet address is reserved?

1. Go to https://app.dextext.com/register
2. Enter the wallet address into the 'Wallet Address' field.
3. If the address is reserved, the field will turn red and display the text:

    > This wallet address is reserved, contact support@dextext.com if you want to claim it.

4. Alternatively, if the address is already registered, the text will read:

    > This wallet address is already registered. Try another.

    Or, if the address is unavailable for security reasons (e.g.@admin), the text will read:

    > This wallet address is unavailable. Try another.

## How can I request to use a reserved wallet address?

If you wish to use a reserved wallet address, please contact support with details of the address you would like to register. If you represent a web3 project, please provide justification or relevant details.

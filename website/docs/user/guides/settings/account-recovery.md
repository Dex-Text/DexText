## Introduction

Your Mailchain account is protected by a unique Secret Recovery Phrase and a strong password. In this article, we will guide you through the process of recovering your Mailchain account using your Secret Recovery Phrase.

## Recovering Your Account

If you have lost or forgotten your password, you can still recover your Mailchain account by providing your username and Secret Recovery Phrase. This will allow you to reset your password and regain access to your account.

Please follow these steps to recover your Mailchain account:

1. Navigate to the [Mailchain account recovery page](https://app.mailchain.com/forgotPassword).
1. Fill in your "Username" in the corresponding field.
1. Enter your "Secret Recovery Phrase" that was generated for you or you entered when you first created your Mailchain account into the designated field. Ensure that you enter the words in the correct order, separated by spaces.
1. Create a new strong password and enter it in the "New Password" field. Your password should be a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   Please make sure you save your password somewhere safe.
1. Re-enter your new password in the "Confirm New Password" field to ensure there are no mistakes.
1. Click on the "Recover Account" button to submit the form.
1. Once your account is successfully recovered, you will be prompted to log in using your username and the new password you just created.
   After logging in, you will regain access to your messages, registered wallets, settings, and other application data.

## Important Reminders

-   Always store your Secret Recovery Phrase and password in a safe and secure location, such as a password manager or a physically locked storage location.
-   If you believe your Secret Recovery Phrase or username and password combination have been compromised, create a new Mailchain account and migrate your blockchain addresses by re-registering them with the new account. This will secure any new messages with the messaging keys for the new account.

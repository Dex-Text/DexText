Mailchain supports addresses on multiple protocols and name services. This guide shows how to resolve an address this checks if the address is supported, valid, and registered.

### Mailable addresses

You can send a message to any supported protocol or name service. Mailchain addresses are fully qualified, they contain the address, protocol/name service and domain. E.g. an Ethereum address looks like this `0xbb56FbD7A2caC3e4C17936027102344127b7a112@ethereum.mailchain.com`, see [address format](../../address-formatting/) for more information.

First install the packages needed.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mailchain/sdk
```

The code below checks if the address is mailable, that is a mail can be sent to it with Mailchain.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{ValidAddress}</CodeBlock>

This should give the below output. This means the address is valid and reachable.

```bash
0xbb56FbD7A2caC3e4C17936027102344127b7a112@ethereum.mailchain.com is reachable.
```

### Registered addresses and optimistic delivery

Mailchain lets you send a mail to all supported and valid addresses, even if they have not yet registered. This is helpful as new users can still read mails sent to them before they registered.

A `ResolvedAddress` has two states, `registered` and `vended` (not registered). The `registered` state means a used has registered their address by providing messaging key which will be used for end-to-end encrypted communication. The `vended` state means the address is not yet registered, and a Mailchain provided messaging key is used for encrypted communication.

There are some situations when it's advisable to check if an address is registered before sending a mail. Examples include:

-   You wish to send a time sensitive mail, and it's not helpful if the user receives the mail at some point in the future.
-   You wish to share secrets or sensitive information. Secrets or sensitive information should only be sent to registered users.

First install the packages needed.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mailchain/sdk
```

The code below shows the different states for a resolved address.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{RegisteredAddress}</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="warning">
	<p>Secrets or sensitive information should only be sent to registered users.</p>
</Admonition>
